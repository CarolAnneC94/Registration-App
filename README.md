# Registration-App

I created a basic sign up, login and logout mobile app using Java and SQLite for the database adapter, this stores the users login information so they can login successfully and not have to create multiple users.

As soon as the user logs in, they are prompoted to the main page where the user can view all the users what are already signed up and not allow the user to use the same email address twice etc.

I had made it basic and simple so users who are not technology friendly.

Below is the app working at full function.
